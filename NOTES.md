**_If you were given 2 weeks time, what changes would you make to the project to enhance code quality, UX, performance, or scalability. This should not take more than ~15 minutes._**
   
I generally like how this project turned out, but a few changes that I could make would be:

1. Improving security such that input html isn't directly added to the dom. This could result in malicious code being injected into the page. 
2. Improve the LLM to actually respond to user's statments. (Though I'm not sure if this is in scope).
3. Move duplicated code to a shared library. One such exmaple is the library used for parsing html. 
4. Move the REST request functions since it is no longer being used.
